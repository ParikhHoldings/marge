# Marge — AI Pastoral Assistant

> "Marge is the church secretary you can't afford — a warm, AI-powered assistant who briefs you every morning on who needs care today, drafts your follow-up messages, tracks every prayer request and visitor, and makes sure no one falls through the cracks."

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /root/marge

# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values (PASTOR_NAME, CHURCH_NAME, etc.)

# 3. Start the API server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# API docs available at:
#   http://localhost:8000/docs      (Swagger UI)
#   http://localhost:8000/redoc
```

## Morning Briefing (Cron)

```bash
# Run manually
python3 scripts/morning_briefing.py

# Schedule for 7 AM daily (cron)
0 7 * * * cd /root/marge && python3 scripts/morning_briefing.py >> /var/log/marge_briefing.log 2>&1
```

Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in `.env` to receive briefings via Telegram.

## API Endpoints

|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/` | Health check |

## Rock RMS Integration

Marge can sync members and attendance from Rock RMS automatically.

1. Add `ROCK_HALLMARK_API_KEY` to your `.env`
2. Call `POST /members/sync/rock` to trigger a sync
3. The app works fully standalone without Rock — the API key is optional

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for all available configuration options.

Key variables:
- `APP_ENV` — `development`, `staging`, or `production`
- `PASTOR_NAME` — Pastor's first name (appears in all drafts)
- `CHURCH_NAME` — Church name (appears in visitor messages)
- `DATABASE_URL` — SQLite for dev, Postgres for staging/production
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — Explicit origin allowlist (required in production)
- `CORS_METHODS` / `CORS_HEADERS` — Scoped CORS methods and headers
- `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS` — Keep `false` for token/header auth strategy
- `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` — Enable optional abuse protection for chat/write endpoints
- `ROCK_HALLMARK_API_KEY` — Optional Rock RMS API key
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` — Optional Telegram delivery


## Security & Deployment Profiles

- Production startup now fails fast when required security config is missing/insecure (e.g., wildcard CORS, SQLite DB, default identity values).
- Optional in-memory rate limiting can be enabled for `/chat` and write-heavy endpoints (`/members`, `/visitors`, `/care`).
- See `docs/DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY.md` for secure staging vs production profiles and environment examples.

## Marge's Voice

Marge is the beloved church secretary who's been at the church 30 years. She's warm, reliable, and never sounds like a database.

**She never says:**
- "Member milestone event detected"
- "Follow-up touchpoint scheduled"
- "I am an AI"

**She always says:**
- "Tom's birthday is Thursday — he'd love a call"
- "Janet could really use a call this week"
- "Good morning, Pastor Nathan. Here are your people for today."
